  first-description_html: |
    <p>Mana Movement is an embodied movement method developed by Mana Mei. This simple yet profound practice flows through a series of guided movement sequences, focusing on spinal mobility, whole body fluidity, release, breath-body connection, and returning to the Feminine Pathways.</p>
    <p>Through cultivating sustained focus and presence with the feeling body, Mana Movement encourages harmonious reconnection to your physical body, awakens creative life force energy, and opens the pathway to somatic healing through the holistic trifecta of mindfulness meditation, physical activation, and spirit awakening.</p>
  second-description_html: |
    <p>The Mana Movement Practice is composed of simple, guided movement exercises, focused on the Feminine Paths of Movement- circles, spirals, and waves.</p>
    <p>Returning to these innate movement patterns with the intention of softening and opening will awaken the natural flow of Life Force Energy through the body, supporting you to feel a deep sense of clarity, peace, expansion, and a renewed sense of inspiration.</p>
    <p>Mana Movement is designed to suit all women, all bodies, at every stage of life and Feminine Rite of Passage.</p>

  - testimonial_html: |
      <p>I feel SO FREE, so nurtured, so present in my body. There is this awakening of feminine energy in me that has taken over. I am creating from this place, nurturing myself and others from this place and overall living from a place of deep awe and pleasure for life. I have fallen in love with this practice.</p>
  - testimonial_html: |
      <p>This work completely changed my life and brought me to find the missing pieces of so many parts of myself, and continues to be my go-to way to come home to myself, clear, align and embody.</p>
  - testimonial_html: |
      <p>I am so happy I have taken the leap, as this wonderful practice has helped me navigate my personal challenges with ease and embody a powerful feminine energy.</p>
  - testimonial_html: |
      <p>My main intention when I began my MANA Movement journey was to feel more open, comfortable, confident, and at ease in my own body—ultimately to trust myself on a deeper level. I wanted to break free of worrying about how others might perceive or judge me. And wow, so far the whole experience has already been about this—and so much more.</p>
  - testimonial_html: |
      <p>I encountered the powerful energy of MANA Movement a few months ago, and it has changed my life. Activating my vital energy every morning has become my power.</p>
  - testimonial_html: |
      <p>It feels right, it feels so natural. My mind is still and quiet. I feel grounded and quiet inside.</p>
  - testimonial_html: |
      <p>I am so grateful for this medicine and the way it weaves through me, supporting me to find ways to embrace all the parts of me that are unknown or I have disowned.</p>
  - testimonial_html: |
      <p>When I did the practice for the first time, I cried ... because it moved me a lot and evoked emotions. After the practice, I felt lightness, softness. I felt like energy, suppressed emotions and blocks came out with each exhalation. It's unbelievable how quickly I was able to go in and feel the change.</p>
  - testimonial_html: |
      <p>My energy is exploding! I feel so emotionally stable and safe. I react to things happening to me with ease and people seem to notice it and treat me differently..  or rather, it's me looking at things through different lenses. Life is just flowing…</p>
  - testimonial_html: |
      <p>I clearly see and feel the changes in my life and in my body. I see more fluidity in every parts of the every day life, professional, personal…It’s really amazing and magical !!! I feel more present, more grounded, more feminine, more aware, more confident, more a lot of things!!! I also have more creativity.</p>
