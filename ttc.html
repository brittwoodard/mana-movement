  heading: What is Mana Movement?
  description_html: |
    <p>Mana Movement is an “all-in-one” embodied movement method developed by Mana Mei. This simple yet profound practice flows through a series of guided movement sequences, focusing on spinal mobility, whole body fluidity, release, breath-body connection, and  returning to the Feminine Pathways.</p>
    <p>Through cultivating sustained focus and presence with the feeling body, Mana Movement encourages harmonious reconnection to your physical body, awakens creative life force energy, and opens the pathway to somatic healing through the holistic trifecta of mindfulness meditation, physical activation, and spirit awakening.</p>
