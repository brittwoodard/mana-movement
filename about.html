            <div class="col-span-11 mb-12">
                <p>5 years ago there was just a girl who liked to dance, who was being supported by other people and didn’t have much of a goal or focus, other than being wildly obsessed with exploring movement through her body.</p>
                <p>One day, she decided to video herself doing a very simple spinal articulation exercise that she posted on social media, because she loved sharing her little dance videos on her IG.</p>
                <p>This little spinal wave video blew up and she received message after message from all sorts of people who were curious what this practice was and how they could learn it. She was shocked.</p>
                <p>And as someone who likes to listen and follow inspiration, she decided to respond to this spark of interest by diving into the creation of a practice that could help people all around the world gain more fluidity, mobility, and awareness in their body.</p>
                <p>She spent hours in her practice space exploring different movement patterns, all focused on circles, spirals, and waves. She drew from her classical ballet training, her years of modern dance training, her education in somatic dance and kinesthetic awareness, and her understanding of energy body and spiritual activation.</p>
                <p>She wanted to create something that was simple, accessible, and yet highly effective in awakening life force energy , activating the physical body, creating more fluidity and mobility, and that felt really really good…</p>
